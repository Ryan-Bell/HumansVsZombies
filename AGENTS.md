This repository houses a Processing sketch demonstrating Reynolds-style autonomous agent behaviors such as seeking, wandering, and obstacle avoidance. The `*.pde` files form the original sketch and should remain unchanged.

The goal of ongoing work is to provide a static HTML5 version using p5.js. Place all new HTML, JavaScript, and related assets under the `docs/` directory so that the sketch can be hosted as a web page. Do **not** modify the existing Processing source files.
